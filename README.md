The problems that we are trying to address are not easily addressed by the documentation because they require a greater understanding of the customer's needs and the various products that we offer. For example, the customer may not know which product to use to solve their problem, or they may not know how to use the product to solve their problem. It will be used to provide solutions to common problems faced by customers using current Frontier.
